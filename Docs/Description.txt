Prompt: Optimizing a Mathematical Model of Chromosome Segregation Across Multiple Datasets

You are an AI assistant tasked with helping to solve a complex problem in computational biology, specifically modeling chromosome segregation during anaphase. The goal is to optimize a mathematical model across multiple datasets corresponding to different mutant types and gain insights into how mutations affect the biological system.

Biological Context

Process Overview: During anaphase, the enzyme Separase cleaves the cohesin complex, allowing sister chromatids to separate. This process is critical for accurate chromosome segregation and must be precisely timed with the assembly of the spindle apparatus to prevent errors.

Importance: Errors in this process can lead to aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome numbers) and tumorigenesis, making it essential to understand the regulation of Separase activity.

Regulation: Separase activity is tightly controlled by inhibitors such as Securin and Cyclin B/CDK1, and its activation is synchronized with the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) via the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Mutations in this system can alter timing and cleavage efficiency.

Mathematical Model

Objective: We model the time difference between the degradation of two proteins involved in this process using a probability density function (PDF) ( f_X(x) ), where ( X = T_1 - T_2 ).

Variables:

( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ): Times for each protein to degrade from ( N ) (initial number of molecules) to ( n ) (threshold number of molecules).

Parameters: ( N ) (initial molecules), ( n ) (threshold), ( k ) (degradation rate).

Individual PDFs: [ f_{\tau_i}(t; n_i, k, N_i) = k \cdot \frac{N_i!}{n_i! (N_i - n_i - 1)!} \cdot e^{-(n_i + 1) k t} \cdot (1 - e^{-k t})^{N_i - n_i - 1}, \quad t \geq 0 ] where ( i = 1, 2 ) corresponds to each protein.

Here is the analytical formula for ( f_X(x) ), the probability density function (PDF) of the time difference ( X = T_1 - T_2 ), where ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ) are the times for two independent proteins to degrade from ( N_1 ) to ( n_1 ) and from ( N_2 ) to ( n_2 ) molecules, respectively, at rates ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ):

[ f_X(x) = \begin{cases} \displaystyle \frac{k_1 \cdot N_1!}{n_1! (N_1 - n_1 - 1)!} \cdot \frac{k_2 \cdot N_2!}{n_2! (N_2 - n_2 - 1)!} \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{N_1 - n_1 - 1} \sum_{j=0}^{N_2 - n_2 - 1} \binom{N_1 - n_1 - 1}{i} \cdot \binom{N_2 - n_2 - 1}{j} \cdot (-1)^{i + j} \cdot \frac{e^{-(n_1 + 1 + i) k_1 x}}{(n_1 + 1 + i) k_1 + (n_2 + 1 + j) k_2} & \text{if } x \geq 0, [10pt] \displaystyle \frac{k_1 \cdot N_1!}{n_1! (N_1 - n_1 - 1)!} \cdot \frac{k_2 \cdot N_2!}{n_2! (N_2 - n_2 - 1)!} \cdot \sum_{i=0}^{N_1 - n_1 - 1} \sum_{j=0}^{N_2 - n_2 - 1} \binom{N_1 - n_1 - 1}{i} \cdot \binom{N_2 - n_2 - 1}{j} \cdot (-1)^{i + j} \cdot \frac{e^{(n_2 + 1 + j) k_2 x}}{(n_1 + 1 + i) k_1 + (n_2 + 1 + j) k_2} & \text{if } x < 0. \end{cases} ]

This formula is derived from the convolution of the individual PDFs of ( T_1 ) and ( -T_2 ), accounting for the factorial and binomial terms that arise in the degradation process.

Time Difference PDF: ( f_X(x) ) is the convolution of ( f_{\tau_1} ) and ( f_{\tau_2} ), representing the distribution of ( X ). Its analytical form involves double sums with factorials and binomial coefficients, leading to numerical instability for large ( N ).

Approximations and Methods

Numerical Stability: To handle large ( N ), we use Stirling's approximation for factorials and binomial coefficients, implemented in logarithmic form to prevent overflow.

Simplification: We approximate ( f_X(x) ) using the Method of Moments (MoM), modeling it as a normal distribution with mean and variance derived from the moments of ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ):

Mean: ( \mu_X = \mu_{T_1} - \mu_{T_2} )

Variance: ( \sigma_X^2 = \sigma_{T_1}^2 + \sigma_{T_2}^2 )

Parameter Estimation

Current Approach: A two-step optimization process:

Global Optimization: Differential evolution to find diverse initial solutions.

Local Optimization: Refinement of these solutions.

Challenges:

Limited diversity in initial solutions from differential evolution.

Numerical instability due to the double sum in the analytical ( f_X(x) ).

Multiple Datasets

Description: We have multiple datasets, each corresponding to a different mutant type. Each mutant affects one parameter consistently across both proteins (e.g., ( n_1 ) and ( n_2 ) scale by the same factor, or ( k ) changes uniformly).

Goal: Adapt the optimization strategy to handle these datasets effectively, potentially using:

Joint estimation with shared parameters across datasets.

A hierarchical modeling approach to account for mutant-specific effects.

Next Steps

Optimization: Fit the model across all datasets to establish baseline parameters (e.g., from wild-type data) and estimate mutant-specific changes.

Biological Insights: Analyze how mutations alter the timing and regulation of chromosome segregation, linking parameter changes to biological outcomes like aneuploidy risk.

Stability: Ensure numerical stability in computations, particularly for large ( N ).
